      <p>Oh, by the Way is a compilation boxed set by Pink Floyd released on 10 December 2007, by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States through Capitol Records.</p>
      <p>The boxed set includes all of Pink Floyd's then extant standard studio albums in scale replicas of the original vinyl packaging. In addition to the albums, and their extras, the set comes with a specially designed 40th Anniversary poster by Storm Thorgerson, featuring 40 Pink Floyd images.</p>
      <p>The title is a reference to a line in the song "Have a Cigar": "Oh by the way, which one's Pink?" The box cover consists of a concept similar to that of Ummagummaâ€”one side of the box shows a picture of a room with various objects scattered about inside it, with pictures of Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright on the walls, whilst the other side shows the same room in different lighting, with the objects and pictures of band members rearranged. Standing in the background of both sides of the cover is the dark silhouette of an individual, to symbolize Syd Barrett.</p>
