      <p class="article"><strong><em>The Division Bell</em></strong> is the <strong>fourteenth studio album</strong> by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on <strong>28 March 1994</strong> by <em>EMI Records</em> in the UK and on <strong>4 April</strong> by <em>Columbia Records</em> in the US.</p>
      <p class="article">The second Pink Floyd album recorded without founding member <a href="../../members/waters.html">Roger Waters</a>, <em>The Division Bell</em> was written mostly by guitarist and singer <a href="../../members/gilmour.html">David Gilmour</a> and keyboardist <a href="../../members/wright.html">Richard Wright</a>. It features Wright's first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since <a href="moon.html"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)</em></a>. Gilmour's fianc√©e, the novelist <em>Polly Samson</em>, co-wrote many of the lyrics, which deal with themes of communication. It was the <strong>last Pink Floyd studio album to be composed of entirely new material</strong>, and the last recorded with Wright, who died in 2008.</p>
      <p class="article">Recording took place in locations including the band's Britannia Row Studios and Gilmour's houseboat, Astoria. The production team included longtime Pink Floyd collaborators such as producer <em>Bob Ezrin</em>, engineer <em>Andy Jackson</em>, saxophonist <em>Dick Parry</em> and bassist <em>Guy Pratt</em>.</p>
      <p class="article"><em>The Division Bell</em> received <strong>mixed reviews</strong>, but <strong>reached number one in more than 10 countries, including the UK and the US</strong>. In the US, it was certified <strong>double platinum</strong> in 1994 and <strong>triple platinum</strong> in 1999. Pink Floyd promoted it with a tour of the US and Europe; the <strong>tour sold more than 5 million tickets and made around $100 million in gross income</strong>. A live album and video, <em>Pulse</em>, was released in 1995. Some of the unused material from the <em>Division Bell</em> sessions became part of Pink Floyd's next album, <a href="endless.html"><em>The Endless River (2014)</em></a>.</p>
