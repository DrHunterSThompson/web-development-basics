        <p class="article"><strong><em>The Final Cut</em></strong> is the <strong>12th studio album</strong> by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on <strong>21 March 1983</strong> through <em>Harvest</em> and <em>Columbia Records</em>. It comprises <strong>unused material from the band's previous studio album</strong>, <a href="wall.html"><em>The Wall (1979)</em></a>, <strong>alongside new material</strong> recorded throughout 1982.</p>
        <p class="article"><em>The Final Cut</em> is the last Pink Floyd album to feature founding member <a href="../../members/waters.html">Roger Waters</a>, who departed from the band in 1985. It is also the only Pink Floyd album not to feature founding member and keyboardist <a href="../../members/wright.html">Richard Wright</a>, who had left the band under pressure from Waters after <em>The Wall</em> sessions. The recording was plagued by conflict; the guitarist, <a href="../../members/gilmour.html">David Gilmour</a>, felt many of the tracks were not worthy of inclusion, but Waters accused him of failing to contribute material himself. The contributions from the drummer, <a href="../../members/mason.html">Nick Mason</a>, were limited mostly to sound effects.</p>
        <p class="article"><em>The Final Cut</em> received <strong>mixed reviews</strong>, though retrospective reception has been <strong>more favourable</strong>. Though it <strong>reached number one in the UK</strong> and <strong>number six in the US</strong>, it was the lowest-selling Pink Floyd studio album worldwide since their sixth album, <a href="meddle.html"><em>Meddle (1971)</em></a>.</p>
