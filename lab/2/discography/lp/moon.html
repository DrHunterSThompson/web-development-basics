      <p class="article"><strong><em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em></strong> is the <strong>eighth studio album</strong> by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on <strong>1 March 1973</strong> by <em>Harvest Records</em>. Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a <strong>concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle</strong>, and also <strong>deal with the mental health problems of former band member <a href="../../members/barrett.html">Syd Barrett</a></strong>, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at <em>EMI Studios</em> (now <em>Abbey Road Studios</em>) in London.</p>
      <p class="article">The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the <strong>extended instrumentals that characterised the band's earlier work</strong>. The group employed <strong>multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers</strong>. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many of the sonic aspects of the recording, and for the recruitment of session singer Clare Torry, who appears on <em>"The Great Gig in the Sky"</em>.</p>
      <p class="article"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> explores <strong>themes such as conflict, greed, time, death and mental illness</strong>. Snippets from interviews with the band's <strong>road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations</strong>.</p>
      <p class="article">The sleeve, which depicts a prismatic spectrum, was designed by <em>Storm Thorgerson</em> in response to keyboardist <a href="../../members/wright.html">Richard Wright's</a> request for a "simple and bold" design which would represent the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles, <em>"Money"</em> and <em>"Us and Them"</em>.</p>
      <p class="article"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> is among the most <strong>critically acclaimed albums</strong> and often features in <strong>professional listings of the greatest albums</strong>. It brought Pink Floyd international fame, wealth, and plaudits to all four band members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> is certified <strong>14 times platinum in the UK</strong>, and <strong>topped the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart</strong>, where it has charted for 977 weeks. As of 2013, <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> has sold over <strong>45 million copies worldwide</strong>, making it <strong>the best-selling album of the 1970s and the fourth-best-selling album in history</strong>.</p>
