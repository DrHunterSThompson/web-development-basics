      <p class="article"><strong><em>Animals</em></strong> is the <strong>tenth studio album</strong> by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on <strong>21 January 1977</strong> through <em>Harvest Records</em> and <em>Columbia Records</em>. The album continued the <strong>longform compositions</strong> that made up their previous works, including <a href="wish.html"><em>Wish You Were Here (1975)</em></a>.</p>
      <p class="article"><em>Animals</em> is <strong>both a progressive rock album and a concept album, focusing on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s Britain</strong>, and was a <strong>change from the style of Pink Floyd's work</strong>. Tension within the band during production culminated in keyboardist <a href="../../members/wright.html">Richard Wright</a> being fired two years later. The album's cover, conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter <a href="../../members/waters.html">Roger Waters</a> and designed by long-time collaborator <em>Storm Thorgerson</em>, shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station.</p>
      <p class="article"><em>Animals</em> reached <strong>number 2 in the UK</strong> and <strong>number 3 in the US</strong>. It initially received mixed reviews, but gained more favourable reviews in later years, and is considered <strong>one of the band's best works</strong>.</p>
