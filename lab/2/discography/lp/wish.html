      <p class="article"><strong><em>Wish You Were Here</em></strong> is the <strong>ninth studio album</strong> by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on <strong>12 September 1975</strong> through <em>Harvest Records</em> and <em>Columbia Records</em>. Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, <em>Wish You Were Here</em> was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at <em>EMI Studios</em> (now <em>Abbey Road Studios</em>) in London.</p>
      <p class="article">The <strong>themes include alienation and criticism of the music business</strong>. The bulk of the album is taken up by <em>"Shine On You Crazy Diamond"</em>, a nine-part tribute to founding member <a href="../../members/barrett.html">Syd Barrett</a>, who left the band seven years earlier due to his deteriorating mental health. Barrett coincidentally visited during the album's production in 1975. Like their previous record, <a href="moon.html"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)</em></a>, Pink Floyd <strong>used studio effects and synthesisers</strong>. Guest singers included Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on <em>"Have a Cigar"</em>, and Venetta Fields, who added backing vocals to <em>"Shine On You Crazy Diamond"</em>. To promote the album, the band released the double A-side single <em>"Have a Cigar" / "Welcome to the Machine"</em>.</p>
      <p class="article">On its release, <em>Wish You Were Here</em> received <strong>mixed reviews from critics</strong>, who found its music uninspiring and inferior to the band's previous work. It has retrospectively received critical acclaim, hailed as <strong>one of the greatest albums of all time</strong>, and was cited by keyboardist <a href="../../members/wright.html">Richard Wright</a> and guitarist <a href="../../members/gilmour.html">David Gilmour</a> as <strong>their favourite Pink Floyd album</strong>.</p>
