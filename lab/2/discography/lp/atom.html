      <p class="article"><strong><em>Atom Heart Mother</em></strong> is the <strong>fifth studio album</strong> by the English band Pink Floyd. It was released by <em>Harvest</em> on <strong>2 October 1970</strong> in the UK, and by <em>Capitol</em> on <strong>10 October 1970</strong> in the US. It was recorded at <em>EMI Studios</em> (now <em>Abbey Road Studios</em>) in London, and was the band's <strong>first album to reach number 1 in the UK</strong>, while it reached number 55 in the US, eventually going <em>gold</em> there.</p>
      <p class="article">The cover was designed by <em>Hipgnosis</em>, and was the first one not to feature the band's name on the cover, or contain any photographs of the band anywhere. This was a trend that would continue on subsequent covers throughout the 1970s and beyond.</p>
