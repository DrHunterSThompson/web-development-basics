      <p class="article"><strong><em>A Saucerful of Secrets</em></strong> is the <strong>second studio album</strong> by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on <strong>28 June 1968</strong> by <em>EMI Columbia</em> in the UK and on <strong>27 July 1968</strong> in the US by <em>Tower Records</em>. During recording, the mental health of singer and guitarist <a href="../../members/barrett.html">Syd Barrett</a> deteriorated, so <a href="../../members/gilmour.html">David Gilmour</a> was recruited; Barrett left the band before the album's completion.</p>
      <p class="article">Whereas Barrett had been the primary songwriter on Pink Floyd's debut album, <a href="piper.html"><em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)</em></a>, on <em>A Saucerful of Secrets</em> each member contributed songwriting and lead vocals. Gilmour appeared on all but two songs, while Barrett contributed to three. <em>"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"</em> is the only song on which all five members appear.</p>
      <p class="article"><em>A Saucerful of Secrets</em> reached <strong>number 9 in the UK charts</strong>, but did not chart in the US until April 2019, peaking at number 158. It received mostly <strong>positive reviews</strong>, though many critics have deemed it inferior to <em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</em>.</p>
