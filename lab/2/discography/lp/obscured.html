      <p class="article"><strong><em>Obscured by Clouds</em></strong> is the <strong>seventh studio album</strong> by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on <strong>2 June 1972</strong> by <em>Harvest</em> and <em>Capitol Records</em>. It serves as the soundtrack for the <em>French film La Vall√©e</em>, by Barbet Schroeder. It was recorded in two sessions in France, while Pink Floyd were in the midst of touring, and produced by the band.</p>
      <p class="article"s><em>Obscured by Clouds</em> is shorter than some of Pink Floyd's previous albums, and makes <strong>heavy use of the acoustic guitar</strong>. Lyrically, the <strong>songs centre around love</strong>, a common theme in the film the album was inspired by. The album's only single was <em>"Free Four"</em>.</p>
      <p class="article"><em>Obscured by Clouds</em> has been seen as a stopgap for the band, who had started work on their next album, <a href="moon.html"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)</em></a>. The album reached <strong>number six in the UK</strong> and <strong>number 46 in the US</strong>; retrospective opinions from both fans and critics have been mixed, some critics noting the similarities to their later material.</p>
