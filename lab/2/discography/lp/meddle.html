      <p class="article"><strong><em>Meddle</em></strong> is the <strong>sixth studio album</strong> by English rock band Pink Floyd, released by <em>Harvest Records</em>. The album was produced between the band's touring commitments, <strong>from January to August 1971</strong> at a series of locations around London, including <em>EMI Studios</em> (now <em>Abbey Road Studios</em>) and <em>Morgan Studios</em>.</p>
      <p class="article">With no material to work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the band devised <strong>a series of novel experiments</strong> which eventually inspired the album's signature track <em>"Echoes"</em>. Although the band's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics written entirely by <a href="../../members/waters.html">Roger Waters</a>, <em>Meddle</em> was a group effort with lyrics primarily by Waters, and is considered a transitional album between the Syd Barrett-influenced group of the late 1960s and the Waters-led era. One single, <em>"One of These Days"</em> b/w <em>"Fearless"</em>, was released from the album.</p>
      <p class="article">The cover has been explained by its creator <em>Storm Thorgerson</em> to be an ear underwater; as with several previous albums designed by <em>Hipgnosis</em>, though, Thorgerson was unhappy with the final result.</p>
      <p class="article">The album was <strong>well received by critics</strong> upon its release, and was <strong>commercially successful in the UK</strong>, but lacklustre publicity on the part of the band's American label Capitol Records led to poor sales there upon initial release.</p>
