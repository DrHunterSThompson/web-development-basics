      <p class="article"><strong><em>1965: Their First Recordings</em></strong> is an <strong>EP</strong> by Pink Floyd released in <strong>2015</strong>. It is made up of music recorded around Christmas 1964, at which time the band was known as the <em>Tea Set</em>. These are <strong>the earliest Pink Floyd recordings available commercially</strong>, with four songs written by <a href="../../members/barrett.html">Syd Barrett</a>, one written by <a href="../../members/waters.html">Roger Waters</a>, and one cover of a song by American blues musician <em>Slim Harpo</em>.</p>
      <p class="article">The drums and guitars were recorded "straight off", while the vocals and piano were recorded at a later date. It was released as a special edition set of two 7" vinyl records, limited to 1,050 copies (1,000 retail and 50 promotional) available only in the EU, to extend the copyright of the recordings. These are the only officially released songs featuring guitarist Rado Klose and Juliette Gale, first wife of keyboardist <a href="../../members/wright.html">Richard Wright</a>. The tracks were later included in the box set <a href="../box-sets/early.html"><em>The Early Years 1965â€“1972</em></a>.</p>
