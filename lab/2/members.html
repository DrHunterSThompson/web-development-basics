			<h1>Band members<hr></h1>

			<p class="article">
				The personnel of the English rock group Pink Floyd has changed several times. The group was founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour would later join the band in January 1968, while Barrett was ousted from the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. From the 1970s onwards, they were augmented by additional personnel in the studio and on stage. Following creative tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Wright rejoined as a session musician and, later, band member. Mason is the only member to appear on all studio releases.
