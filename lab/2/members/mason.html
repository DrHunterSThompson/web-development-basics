			<p class="article"><strong>Nicholas Berkeley Mason</strong> (born 27 January 1944) is an English <strong>drummer</strong> and a founder member of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. He has been the only constant member since the band's formation in 1964, and is the only member <strong>to appear on every Pink Floyd album</strong>. He co-wrote Pink Floyd compositions including <em>"Echoes"</em>, <em>"Time"</em>, <em>"Careful with That Axe, Eugene"</em>, and <em>"One of These Days"</em>. <strong>Influenced by jazz and big band music</strong>, Mason embraced <strong>acoustic drums</strong> (both single- and double-headed), <strong>tuned percussion</strong>, <strong>electronic drums and Rototoms</strong>, melding all of these into a melodic whole.</p>
			<p class="article">In 2018, he formed a new band, <em>Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets</em>, to perform music from Pink Floyd's early years. He was inducted into the <em>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</em> in 1996 as a member of Pink Floyd.</p>
