			<p class="article"><strong>George Roger Waters</strong> (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician, singer-songwriter and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd as the <strong>bassist</strong>. Following the departure of singer-songwriter Syd Barrett in 1968, Waters also became the band's <strong>lyricist, co-lead vocalist and conceptual leader</strong> until his departure in 1985.</p>
			<p class="article">Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums <a href="../discography/lp/moon.html"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)</em></a>, <a href="../discography/lp/wish.html"><em>Wish You Were Here (1975)</em></a>, <a href="../discography/lp/animals.html"><em>Animals (1977)</em></a>, <a href="../discography/lp/wall.html"><em>The Wall (1979)</em></a>, and <a href="../discography/lp/final.html"><em>The Final Cut (1983)</em></a>. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute over the use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987. Waters's solo work includes the studio albums <em>The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984)</em>, <em>Radio K.A.O.S. (1987)</em>, <em>Amused to Death (1992)</em>, and <em>Is This the Life We Really Want? (2017)</em>.</p>
			<p class="article">In 1990, Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, <em>The Wall – Live in Berlin</em>, with an attendance of 450,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the <em>US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</em> in 1996 and the <em>UK Music Hall of Fame</em> in 2005. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd for the <em>Live 8</em> global awareness event, the group's only appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999; he performed <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> in its entirety for his world tour of 2006–2008, and the <em>Wall Live</em> tour of 2010–2013 was the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist at the time.</p>
