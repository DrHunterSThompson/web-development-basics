			<p class="article"><strong>Richard William Wright</strong> (28 July 1943 â€“ 15 September 2008) was an English musician who co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. He <strong>played keyboards and sang</strong>, appearing on almost every Pink Floyd album and performing on all their tours. He was inducted into the <em>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</em> in 1996 as a member of Pink Floyd.</p>
			<p class="article">Wright grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex, and met his future Pink Floyd bandmates <a href="waters.html">Roger Waters</a> and <a href="mason.html">Nick Mason</a> while studying architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic, London. After being joined by frontman and songwriter <a href="barrett.html">Syd Barrett</a>, Pink Floyd found commercial success in 1967.</p>
			<p class="article">Initially contributing more as a <strong>singer-songwriter</strong>, Wright later acted mainly as an <strong>arranger on compositions</strong> by <a href="waters.html">Waters</a> and <a href="gilmour.html">Gilmour</a>. Wright's <strong>jazz influences and distinctive keyboard playing</strong> were an important part of the Pink Floyd sound. As well as playing Farfisa and Hammond organs and Kurzweil synthesisers, he <strong>sang regularly in the band</strong> and took lead vocals on songs such as <em>"Remember a Day" (1968)</em>, <em>"Time" (1973)</em> and <em>"Wearing the Inside Out" (1994)</em>.</p>
			<p class="article">He began to contribute less towards the end of the 1970s and left the band after touring <a href="../discography/lp/wall.html"><em>The Wall</em></a> in 1981. He rejoined as a session player in 1987 for <a href="../discography/lp/momentary.html"><em>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</em></a>, and rejoined full-time for <a href="../discography/lp/division.html"><em>The Division Bell</em></a> in 1994. Sessions with Wright during this period were later released on the 2014 album <a href="../discography/lp/endless.html"><em>The Endless River</em></a>. Away from Pink Floyd, Wright recorded two solo albums and was briefly active in the pop duo Zee with Dave Harris of Fashion.</p>
