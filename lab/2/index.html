			<p class="article"><strong><em>Pink Floyd</em></strong> are an English rock band formed in London in <strong>1965</strong>. Gaining an early following as <strong>one of the first British psychedelic groups</strong>, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as <strong>the greatest progressive rock band of all time</strong>.</p>

			<p class="article">Pink Floyd were founded by <strong><a href="members/barrett.html">Syd Barrett</a> (guitar, lead vocals)</strong>, <strong><a href="members/mason.html">Nick Mason</a> (drums)</strong>, <strong><a href="members/waters.html">Roger Waters</a> (bass guitar, vocals)</strong>, and <strong><a href="members/wright.html">Richard Wright</a> (keyboards, vocals)</strong>. Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album <a href="discography/lp/piper.html"><em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)</em></a>. <strong>The guitarist and vocalist <a href="members/gilmour.html">David Gilmour</a></strong> joined in January 1968; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, <a href="discography/lp/moon.html"><em>The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)</em></a>, <a href="discography/lp/wish.html"><em>Wish You Were Here (1975)</em></a>, <a href="discography/lp/animals.html"><em>Animals (1977)</em></a> and <a href="discography/lp/wall.html"><em>The Wall (1979)</em></a>.
