      <p>Animals is the tenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 January 1977 through Harvest Records and Columbia Records. The album continued the longform compositions that made up their previous works, including Wish You Were Here (1975).</p>
      <p>Animals is both a progressive rock album and a concept album, focusing on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s Britain, and was a change from the style of Pink Floyd's work. Tension within the band during production culminated in keyboardist Richard Wright being fired two years later. The album's cover, conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters and designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson, shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station.</p>
      <p>Animals reached number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the US. It initially received mixed reviews, but gained more favourable reviews in later years, and is considered one of the band's best works.</p>
